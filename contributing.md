# Contirbuting

For testing the bezier algorithms we use [SFML 2.2](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.2/),
be sure to download and follow the set up tutorial from the
[SFML getting started page](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.2/#getting-started).

If you are already working in Visual Studio, you can download and extract SFML, then
set the environment variable `SFML_HOME` to the current directory of your SFML.

Then, don't forget to drop the `.dll` files into your output directory so the debugging
program can access them.
